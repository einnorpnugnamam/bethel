## Setup

#### Requirements
* NodeJS (https://nodejs.org/en/)
* Gulp (http://gulpjs.com/)

To make sure you have Node, npm, and gulp installed, run three simple commands to see what version of each is installed:
* To see if Node is installed, type `node -v` in Terminal. This should print the version number.
* To see if NPM is installed, type `npm -v` in Terminal. This should print the version number.
* To see if gulp is installed, type `gulp -v` in Terminal. This should print the version number.
